## Description

YIELD: 4 to 6 servings

TIME: 25 minutes

When baked, feta gains an almost creamy texture, similar to goat cheese but with feta’s characteristic tang. In this easy vegetarian sheet-pan dinner, broccolini (or broccoli), grape tomatoes and lemon slices roast alongside the feta until the broccolini crisp, the tomatoes burst and the lemon rinds soften. (Remember, broccolini has a tender, delicious stalk so only the bottom 1/2-inch needs to be trimmed.) Serve this dish over a pile of orzo for a complete meal. If you like, cut the broccolini, feta and lemon into bite-size pieces and toss with the orzo.

## Ingredients
* 1 bunch broccolini, ends trimmed, thick stalks split lengthwise, or broccoli, stalks trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
* 1 pint grape tomatoes, halved (about 2 cups)
* 1 small red onion, peeled, quartered and cut into 2-inch wedges
* 1 lemon, 1/2 cut into thin rounds and the remaining 1/2 left intact, for serving
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 2 (6- to 8-ounce) blocks feta, cut into 1-inch slices
* Cooked orzo or farro, for serving
* ½ cup fresh basil or cilantro leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped (optional)

## Preparation

1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the lower third. On a sheet pan, combine the broccolini, tomatoes, onion and lemon slices with the olive oil and toss. Add cumin and red-pepper flakes, season with salt and pepper, and toss again until evenly coated. Nestle the feta slices into the vegetables. (It’s OK if they break apart a little.)

1. Roast 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through but leaving the feta in place, until the broccolini is charred at the tips, the stems are easily pierced with a fork and the tomato skins start to blister and break down.

1. Serve over orzo or farro. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with the remaining lemon half for squeezing. Top with fresh herbs, if using.
