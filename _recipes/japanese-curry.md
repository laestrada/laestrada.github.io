## Ingredients:

### For the curry:

* 1 large (300 g) onion, sliced into wedges
* 2 garlic cloves, grated
* 2 tsp ginger, grated
* 1/2 (150 g) package mushrooms, cut into large chunks
* 1 (150 g) carrot, cut into wedges
* 2–3 (250 g) potatoes, cut into large chunks
* 3/4 cup (60 g) soy curls (or substitute crumbled firm tofu)
* 1/2 (100 g) apple, grated
* 2 1/2 cup (625 ml) vegetable broth or water
* 1/2 box (120 g) {curry roux cubes}(https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Curry-Sauce-Medium-8-4-Ounce/dp/B00VEJCJSC)
* Salt and pepper, to taste

### Kakushi aji (hidden flavours)
* 1/3 cup (100 g) caramelized onions (300g onion, 1 tbsp butter)
* 1 tbsp Japanese Worcester or Tonkatsu sauce (15ml)
* 1 tbsp ketchup (15ml)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce (15ml // tamari for gluten free)
* 1 tbsp sugar of choice (14g)
* 1 tsp cocoa powder (3g)
* 1 tsp instant coffee (3g)

### To serve
* 4 cups Japanese white rice, cooked
* fukushinzuke (pickled soy sauce vegetables)
* parsley


## Preparation

1. Over medium high heat, add onion wedges and fry for 1 minute. Add in garlic and ginger and fry for another minute.  
2. Add in the mushrooms, carrots, potatoes and soy curls, and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Add vegetable broth or water, along with the grated apple. 
4. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a low. Simmer for 15 minutes or until you can pierce a toothpick through the potato chunks.
5. Meanwhile, prepare caramelized onions.  
6. Turn off the heat. Chop up the roux into small pieces (so it dissolves more easily). Add the chopped roux to a soup ladle and dissolve it well into the curry. 
7. Add kakushi aji and mix well to combine.
8. Turn heat to low and simmer to thicken, about 5 minutes. 
9. Serve over rice and enjoy! 


## Notes
Instant pot method: Set to ‘Sauté’ mode and follow steps 1-3. Cancel saute, then cover and lock the lid. Pressure cook on high for 8-10 minutes. Manually release pressure or let it release naturally. Cancel, set to sauté on low heat, then mix in roux and other flavorings.
