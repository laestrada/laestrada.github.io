##  Description

Quick, creamy, surprisingly complex in flavor! If you don't have gochujang, sriracha works great too. We also often sub crushed red pepper for gochugaru.

## Ingredients:
* 2 tbsp butter
* 4 cloves (16 g) garlic, minced
* 1 small (80 g) onion, finely diced
* 2 scallions, greens and whites separated
* 1 tbsp ginger, grated
* 2–3 tbsp (32 g) gochujang, to taste
* 2 tsp gochugaru
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1 cup (180 g) red lentils, rinsed
* 2 cups (500 ml) vegetable broth
* 1 14 oz can coconut milk or 400 ml half and half
* 1 tsp salt, to taste
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* lime juice, for serving (optional)
* cilantro for serving (optional)
* roasted cashews, chopped (optional)
* rice for serving (optional)

## Preparation
1. Melt butter in medium pot or large pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions, white part of scallion, garlic, and ginger. Cook for about 3-5 minutes.


2. Add the gochujang, gochugaru, and sugar and cook for about 2 minutes until caramelized.

3. Add the lentils, broth, coconut milk, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 18-22 minutes, or until lentils are soft.

4. Drizzle in soy sauce and stir to combine.

5. Serve with rice, lime juice, cashews, cilantro and scallion tops. Enjoy!

## Notes
Instant pot method: Set to ‘Sauté’ mode and follow steps 1-2. Add the lentils, broth, coconut milk, salt and pepper. Press Cancel and close lid with vent in sealing position. Cook on Manual High Pressure for 5 minutes. Natural release 10 minutes. Stir in soy sauce.
