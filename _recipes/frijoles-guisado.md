## Ingredients
- ~1.5 tablespoons olive oil
- .5 yellow onion, diced.
- .5 pepper (any color), diced. 
- 4 cloves garlic crushed (or minced)
- .25 to .5 bottle pitless goya manzanilla olives with pimientos. Ideally cut up.
- 2-3 tablespoons tomato paste
- .5-1 packet goya sazon w/ coriander and annatto (orange box)
- 1 can of beans
- 1.5 teaspoons oregano
- 1.5 teaspoons cumin
- salt and pepper to taste
- optional: cilantro for garnish

## Preparation:

1. Heat up olive oil in a medium sized pan. Add diced pepper, onion, oregano, and cumin. Stir occasionally.

2. When the onions have softened add garlic. Let cook for ~1 minute, then add olives. Don't be afraid to put the olive liquid in too -- it adds flavor!

3. Add tomato paste, beans, and sazon. Stir it all up and let it simmer for at least 10 minutes. Add water if it is too viscous.

4. Salt to taste. Add garnish of cilantro just before serving.

#### Variation
- You can also make this recipe with chicken or shrimp instead of beans. The only difference is you need to add more liquid and increase the cook time.
