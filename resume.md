application. I was heavily involved in standing up the necessary devOps
infrastructure and coding both the client-side and server-side
applications

**IHM Insights**\
Developed a high volume, cloud-based medical data ingest and egress
system for the Institute for Health Metrics. I worked as one the sole
contributors handling the ingestion and transformation of EHR data from
over 50 hospitals into our canonical persistence store on the cloud.
This project involved leveraging a wide variety of AWS services
including AWS Glue (Pyspark), Lambda, Step Functions, RDS Aurora, ECS,
etc.

**J&J JLabs Navigator**\
Developed a web application for Johnson & Johnson's incubator program
(JLABS). Worked on the client-side application to replace their legacy
Drupal application with a new Angular version that provides richer
interactions and visualizations.

Programmed tools in Matlab and Python to fetch and analyze seismic noise
from IRIS data center

**Paleontology Scripting Analysis**\
Wrote Python scripts to interact and analyze data from Macrostrat and
the Paleobio Database API's

**Roguelike Game Development**\
Implemented and developed JavaScript rogue-like video game
