### Projects and Research

**Acushnet Artworks**\
Worked as part of a small development team to implement a logo
management web application for the Acushnet Holdings Corporation. This
project utilized Angular for the front end application and .NET Core for
the backend. This project was deployed and run with an entirely
serverless footprint using AWS ECS to run a dockerized version of the
application. I was heavily involved in standing up the necessary devOps
infrastructure and coding both the client-side and server-side
applications

**IHM Insights**\
Developed a high volume, cloud-based medical data ingest and egress
system for the Institute for Health Metrics. I worked as one the sole
contributors handling the ingestion and transformation of EHR data from
over 50 hospitals into our canonical persistence store on the cloud.
This project involved leveraging a wide variety of AWS services
including AWS Glue (Pyspark), Lambda, Step Functions, RDS Aurora, ECS,
etc.

**J&J JLabs Navigator**\
Developed a web application for Johnson & Johnson's incubator program
(JLABS). Worked on the client-side application to replace their legacy
Drupal application with a new Angular version that provides richer
interactions and visualizations.

**Seismic Data Tools**\
Programmed tools in Matlab and Python to fetch and analyze seismic noise
from IRIS data center

**Paleontology Scripting Analysis**\
Wrote Python scripts to interact and analyze data from Macrostrat and
the Paleobio Database API's

**Roguelike Game Development**\
Implemented and developed JavaScript rogue-like video game
