  <div class="bio">I am a PhD Candidate in Harvard's <a href="https://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/">Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group</a>. I am interested in using technology to improve understanding of earth systems. My current project focuses on developing open-source, user friendly software to quantify and monitor methane emissions through a combination of satellite data and inverse modeling techniques. For more information, check out the <a href="https://integratedmethaneinversion.github.io/">IMI website</a>. I spend my free time running, climbing, cooking, and playing with dogs.</div>
